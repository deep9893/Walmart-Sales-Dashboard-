# Walmart-Sales-Dashboard-




I have successfully Created dark theme #Report using #MicrosoftPowerBIDesktop and #PowerBIService. Have a look.

For creating a dashboard, Steps I followed:
1. Connect the data (single or multiple sources).
2. Transform the data (power query).
3. Load the data (Close & Apply).

**These three steps are known as ETL (Extract Transform Load) process.

4. Data Modeling (Relationship building).
5. Calculating required parameters/columns/fields (DAX: Data Analysis Expressions, Calculated Columns, Measures).
6. Report building (Data visualization).

**Above six steps are performed in our local Desktop Application.

7. Publishing Report/Dashboard (Power BI service).
8. In power BI dashboard is created on power BI service not on Power BI desktop.
9. Share and collaborate (Row level security).
